# Introduction
<img src="../../../assets/release_record_compiled.png" width="150" align="right"/><span class="lead">Governments around the world spend an estimated US$9.5 trillion through contracts every year. Yet, contracting information is often unavailable for public scrutiny. To change this, the [Open Contracting Partnership (OCP)](http://www.open-contracting.org/) is working to increase disclosure and participation in contracting.</span>

<span class="lead">The Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) project exists to formalize how contracting data and documents can be published in an accessible, structured and repeatable way.</span>

This website currently contains an initial version of the schema that has been designed around contracts awarded through a standard tendering process. However, the standard is flexible and, through specific extensions, can be used to describe other kinds of contracts, including contracts related to land and extractive industries.

The Open Contracting Data Standard is a core product of the [Open Contracting Partnership](http://www.open-contracting.org) (OCP). Version 1.0 of the standard is being developed for the OCP by the [World Wide Web Foundation](http://www.webfoundation.org), through a project supported by the [Omidyar Network](http://www.omidyar.net) and the [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org).

# Getting Started

OCDS is an open data standard for publication of structured information on all stages of a contracting process: from initiation to implementation.

The publication of OCDS data can enable greater transparency in public contracting, and can support accessible and in-depth analysis of how public resources are being used. 

To get started publishing OCDS data:

* Identify the key [users and use cases](use_cases.md) for your OCDS project
* Map out the data and documents you will publish from your [contracting process](contracting_process.md)
* Present the data in [JSON releases and records](releases_and_records.md)
* Publish your data on the web using the [publication patterns](publication_patterns.md)
* Check the [validation of your data](validation.md)

You can find [samples of OCDS data](ToDo), and [information on using OCDS](ToDo) in the implementation handbook.

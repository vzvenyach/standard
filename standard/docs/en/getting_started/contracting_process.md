## The Contracting Process

There are many different stages to a contracting process. OCDS provides a way to bring data together across all links of the contracting chain.

OCDS covers:

Not all contracting processes have all these stages. For example, direct contracting may start with the award of a contract. However, there will still be information that can be disclosed about the budgets, specifications and selection process even in this case. 

You should aim to publish OCDS data close to real-time: releasing data as each stage of a contracting process takes place.

This may involve generating output from a range of different systems. Data published from different systems can be tied together by use of a common Open Contracting ID (```ocid```).

### Defining a contracting process

For public procurement OCDS defines a unique contracting process as:

> All the planning, tendering information, awards and contracts related to a single initiation process.

An initiation process may be a tender, a direct contract award, or a call to award a concession.

### The Open Contracting ID (ocid)

Each unique contracting process should be assigned an ```ocid```. This is an identifier which can be used to join up data between stages and systems. 

To make sure the ```ocid```s assigned by two different publishers do not clash, publishers are encouraged to register a publisher prefix. This can be prepended onto locally generated identifiers, giving a globally unique identifier, and allowing disparate data sources to confidently refer to a unique contracting process. 

TODO: You can register your ocid prefix here.

<p class="first admonition-title">Worked Example</p>

In [Mexico City](http://www.contratosabiertos.cdmx.gob.mx/), an initial mapping identified that identifiers were assigned to each tender process or direct award, using a pattern based on the initials or name of the department involved, a tender or contract number, and the year. 

For example:

> OM-DGRMSG-004-13

These identifiers uniquely identify each contracting process. Fields and business processes to capture these identifiers at each contracting process stage were added to the relevant systems.

Mexico City then registered a prefix with the OCDS helpdesk. They have been given the prefix 'ocds-87sd3t' which can be added to their unique process identifiers to give a globally unique ocid. 

For example:

> ocds-87sd3t-OM-DGRMSG-004-13

All the award notices, contracts and transactions resulting from the tender with this identifier should also share this ocid - allowing Mexico City to bring together a complete picture of each contracting process.

<div class="warning" markdown=1>
    
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
    
The ```ocid``` is case sensitive. Case should be used consistently whenever an ```ocid``` is presented.

### More that just procurement

Version 1.0 of the OCDS schema is optimised for procurement-type contracts. 

However, using extensions OCDS can also be used to model other kinds contracting process. 

Work is underway to add formal support for concession contracts, and public-private partnership contracts.
